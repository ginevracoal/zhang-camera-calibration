# Zhang Camera Calibration

This is Project 1 for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition course

1. apply the code as it is for homography estimation, then perform **camera calibration**;
2. choose one of the calibration images and compute the total **reprojection error** (Lecture 2, page 62) for all the grid points (adding a figure with the reprojected points);
3. add **radial distortion compensation** (Lecture 2, page 70) to the basic Zhangâ€™s calibration procedure;
4. compute the total reprojection error with radial distortion compensation and make a comparison to the one without compensation;
5. **superimpose an object** (for instance, a cylinder as in Fig. 1), to the calibration plane, in all the images employed for the calibration;
6. optionally, you could print a calibration object and apply the previous steps to a set of images acquired with your own smartphone, webcam or sdigital camera (thus, calibrating your device).
